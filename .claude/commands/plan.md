Analyze the user's request and produce an implementation plan.

Steps:
1. Read CLAUDE.md, docs/LESSONS.md, and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for context
2. Explore the codebase to understand current state
3. Break the work into numbered phases — each phase should leave the game in a working state
4. For large tasks, use task tracking (TaskCreate) to create trackable items per phase
5. Write the plan to a markdown file (e.g., `docs/plan-<feature>.md`) with:
   - Overview of what's changing
   - Phases with specific file changes listed
   - Verification criteria per phase
6. Present the plan for review before execution

Keep plans concrete — list specific functions, elements, and styles that will change.
